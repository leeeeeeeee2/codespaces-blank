# Compilation

The section 'Dependencies' lists the general requirements
for the compilation. The section 'System-dependent dependency installation'
gives some instructions on how to install these dependencies on Windows,
some Linux-distributions and MacOS.
Conda based dependency installation is described in the section 'Conda dependent installation'.

## Dependencies

To clone and compile MPR you need at least the following:

* Fortran compiler: We support [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/), [nagfor](https://www.nag.com/content/nag-fortran-compiler) and [ifort](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/overview.html)
* Build system: We support [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/): Software for build automation
* [NetCDF-Fortran](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran): NetCDF I/O for Fortran
* [git](https://git-scm.com/): version control system
* (optional) [fypp](https://github.com/aradi/fypp): Fortran pre-processor written in Python


## Conda dependent installation

The simplest way to compile this project on your local computer is to use a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment (on Linux (including WSL) or MacOS) provided by [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) to install NetCDF, a Fortran compiler, make, cmake.

On Windows we recommend to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (WSL) to be able to use Linux (see above) and set up conda there.

You can get the latest version of **Miniforge** with (for Linux/MacOS/WSL):
```bash
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```

To create a (local) conda environment with all dependencies type the following:
```bash
conda create -y --prefix ./mpr_env
conda activate ./mpr_env
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda install -y cmake make fortran-compiler netcdf4 netcdf-fortran fypp f90nml python-graphviz ncview 
```

Then you can proceed with cloning and compiling.

## System-dependent dependency installation

After you installed all dependencies on your system you can proceed with cloning and compiling.


#### Unix (Linux / MacOS)

1. MacOS with [homebrew](https://brew.sh) available:
    ```bash
    brew install git gcc netcdf cmake
    ```

1. Ubuntu, Mint and other apt-get based systems with matching repositories:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install git gfortran netcdf-bin libnetcdf-dev libnetcdff-dev cmake
    ```

2. Archlinux:
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S git gcc-libs netcdf-fortran cmake
    ```

3. yum based systems (CentOS, OpenSuse):
    ```bash
    sudo yum -y install git gcc-gfortran netcdf-fortran cmake
    ```

#### Windows

On Windows 10 and later we recommend to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (WSL) to be able to use Linux by e.g. [installing Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10) there.

Easiest way to do so is:

1. install the [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701)
2. open the Windows Terminal and type:
    ```bash
    wsl --install -d ubuntu
    ```

3. Open Ubuntu from the new entry in the start menu

Then you can follow the install instructions for Ubuntu from above.

If you rather want to use [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
(tool providing Linux functionality on Windows), step-by-step guidelines on
how to install all Cygwin libraries can be viewed in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/FGJOcYEzbP4)
created by Mehmet CÃ¼neyd Demirel (Istanbul Technical University).

#### Module systems

If you are on a module system, load the modules gcc or intel depending on your
favorite compiler. Then, load the modules netcdf-fortran and cmake.

These modules will have system specific names, environments, etc.
You may use `module spider` to find the right packages and the
right dependencies, potentially use corresponding wiki pages.


##### On EVE (the cluster at the UFZ)

A set of load-scripts is provided in `hpc-module-loads` (see the [repository](https://git.ufz.de/chs/HPC-Fortran-module-loads) for more details), to load all needed modules for specific compilers:

- Example: GNU 7.3 compiler (`foss/2018b` Toolchain):
  ```bash
  source hpc-module-loads/eve.gcc73
  ```
  or (MPI support)
  ```bash
  source hpc-module-loads/eve.gcc73MPI
  ```

## Cloning the repository

First you need to clone the repository (if you already have `git`, otherwise see below):
```bash
git clone https://git.ufz.de/chs/mpr.git
```

This will give you a new folder `mpr/` containing the whole repository. You can go into it by:
```bash
cd mpr/
```

If you then want to compile a specific version (different from the latest development version), you can check that out with e.g.:
```bash
git checkout v1.0.4
```

Afterwards you can continue with the compilation.


## Compilation commands

It could be necessary to set your desired fortran compiler with an environment variable, e.g.:
```bash
export FC=gfortran
```
The compilation exclusively runs with cmake.
The basic cmake workflow, to configure and compile in a `build/` folder, is:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

You can control all `cmake` options by passing them as directives staring with `-D` to the cmake configuration.
For example for debug configuration, you can do the following:
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DGENERATE_TFS_CONFIG=<path_to_nml>
```

To configure the build interactively, you can also use [ccmake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ccmake.1.html) (command line tool) or the [CMake GUI](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-gui.1.html) (graphical user interface).
Check their respective documentation for further information.
To use `ccmake` you can do the following:
```bash
cmake -B build
ccmake build
```

Then set your desired options and re-configure your build (by pressing `c`).
Afterwards build you project as always by executing:
```bash
cmake --build build --parallel
```


## Installation of MPR

To install MPR after compilation, i.e. make it available as a command `mpr`, you can do the following (assuming you used the above cmake commands, otherwise replace `build` with the respective build folder):
```bash
cmake --install build
```

If you need to provide a prefix, where to install it, you can just pass one. For example, if you used a conda environment for compilation, you can also install mhm there with:
```bash
cmake --install build --prefix $CONDA_PREFIX
```

## Compilation without Internet

Starting with version 5.12, MPR is depending on [FORCES](https://git.ufz.de/chs/forces/), our Fortran library for Computational Environmental Systems.
This library is downloaded on the fly by [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake), the cmake package manager.

If you don't want to download it indirectly, know you wont have internet during your development or you want to work on routines provided by FORCES, you can place a copy of the FORCES repository in the root of your cloned MPR repository by e.g.:
```bash
git clone https://git.ufz.de/chs/forces.git
```
The new folder `forces/` will be automatically recognized during compilation as described above and nothing will be downloaded.

If you just want a specific version (see `src/CMakeLists.txt` for the currently used one), do this:
```bash
git clone --branch v0.3.2 --depth 1 https://git.ufz.de/chs/forces.git
```
